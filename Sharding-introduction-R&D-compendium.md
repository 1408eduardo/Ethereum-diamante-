### Simple summary of sharding

Sharding involves adding new shard chains to the main Ethereum blockchain, so that a computer doesn't have to download and compute every transaction in the history of the blockchain in order to make a new transaction or otherwise participate in securing and using Ethereum. Another way to express this is to partition the state into multiple shards that are handled in parallel by different subsets of securing participants (notaries, proposers and validators)[1](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/406.pdf). The primary goal is a massive scalability improvement, potentially exponential in later stages of the [roadmap](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-roadmap). Each one of the shards (likely 100 live) will have as high a capacity (and likely more with phase 1) than the current existing Ethereum chain. A smart contract will exist on the main chain, called the sharding manager contract, which manages how data and transactions in shards are accepted as valid by the main chain, via notaries voting on the validity and data availability of collations (collections of data and transactions, analogous to blocks, but where they occur more frequently than blocks) in shards, and proposers proposing blobs (analogous to transactions but without execution in [phase 1](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-roadmap)) which are collected into collations.

### Implementations
Implementations under development include:
- [sharding utils](https://github.com/ethereum/sharding): has the sharding manager contract and interfaces.
- py-evm/Trinity: [Gitter](https://gitter.im/ethereum/py-evm), [Github: sharding](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/tree/sharding), [Github: Trinity](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/tree/trinity). Trinity is the planned/under development EVM that will run a node and network.
- Geth-sharding: [Github](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/geth-sharding), [Gitter](https://gitter.im/prysmaticlabs/geth-sharding), [website](https://prysmaticlabs.com/).
- [Drops of Diamond](https://github.com/Drops-of-Diamond/diamond_drops): using the fast, safe and concurrent [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) programming language.
- Nimbus ([doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14u65XVNLOd83cq3t7wNC9UPweZ6kPWvmXwRTWWn0diQ/edit#)): an implementation in Nim which compiles to C, and would be good for integrating with [Hera](https://github.com/ewasm/hera), an eWASM implementation in C++. Developed by Status, they are looking to support mobile phones.
- [PegaSys](https://twitter.com/PegasysEng) (ConsenSys): developing a client that is targeted for enterprise users.

### Independent research
- Cambridge Army, @maxc on https://ethresear.ch, working on reducing the number of rounds of interactive verification e.g. with execution tracing, parallelism, or breaking up a transaction into smaller ones if a certain number of steps of verification have been reached.

### Alternative scaling approaches to sharding

Alternative approaches to scaling other than sharding include state channels, side chains, multi-chains and off-chain computation. Projects are included [here in this summary spreadsheet by the Web3 Foundation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BQ0bK_LhSQvxtvXryVoIcmxeKMuVJCq6oD0aS5_hpC8). [Parity Substrate](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/8dgoup/parity_substrate/) is another project. Other designs and sources of inspiration include:
- [Dfinity](https://www.dfinity.org/pdf-viewer/pdfs/viewer?file=../library/dfinity-consensus.pdf), uses a random beacon chain and notaries, which Ethereum plans to implement, although the [randomness](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Topics-that-span-across-research-categories:-randomness,-economics,-etc.#randomness) source will be [RANDAO](https://github.com/ethereum/research/blob/master/sharding_fork_choice_poc/beacon_chain_node.py) instead of BLS aggregate signatures.
- [Truebit](https://truebit.io/) interactive verification

Potential sources of inspiration / other projects include:
- [PHANTOM and SPECTRE, alternative DAG designs](https://ethresear.ch/t/phantom-and-spectre-by-a-zohar-and-y-sompolinsky/1888)
- [Ziliqa](https://docs.zilliqa.com/whitepaper.pdf): a PoW sharded architecture consisting of a dataflow smart contract layer, and 5 other layers. Uses the EC-Schnorr multiginature signature scheme. However, RANDAO is preferable to aggregate/multisignature schemes since it is not prone to a 51% attack. Also uses committees, as is planned with Dfinity and Ethereum, although here the committees manage how miners are assigned to shards, whereas in Ethereum that is the task of the beacon chain and the sharding manager contract on the main chain. Uses PBFT consensus, which doesn't seem to be as good as [Casper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Casper-Proof-of-Stake-compendium) [FFG](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1011), which is also used with PoW.

- [Algorand](https://www.algorand.com/whitepapers/)
- [OmniLedger](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/406.pdf)
- plus a lot more inspiration from research literature.
