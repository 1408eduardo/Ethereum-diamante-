A broad introduction to and overview of Ethereum research is available at [Ethereum 2 and alternative PoS implementations](https://ethresear.ch/t/ethereum-2-and-alternative-pos-implementations/190/7), however this is now somewhat outdated.

### Sharding:
- [Sharding phase 1 draft specification](https://ethresear.ch/t/sharding-phase-1-spec/1407)
- [Sharding FAQ](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ)
- [Ethereum Research Sharding Compendium](http://notes.ethereum.org/s/BJc_eGVFM)
- [Sharding implementations](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-and-stateless-client-implementations);

The above links also link to many topics that are in the sharding roadmap, such as:
- [eWASM](https://github.com/ewasm),
- Casper proof of stake,
    * [Search results on ethresear.ch](https://ethresear.ch/search?q=Casper)
    * [Proof of Stake FAQ](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ)
- zk-STARKs, e.g. videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUN35BC11Qw&t=2s), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VuZvdxFZQo&t=7s) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VuZvdxFZQo&t=7s), as well as a paper [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/046) (the abstract is a more succinct intro than the videos), while the full paper is more detailed; and

### Ethereum research communication channels
* [Ethereum research Discourse forum](https://ethresear.ch/). An introduction to the site is [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/read-this-before-posting/8), which includes onboarding packets for potential collaborators with generic research and programming language theory;
* [Ethereum research repo](https://github.com/ethereum/research); and 
* [Ethereum research gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/ethereum/research).

Many research topics are related to improving scalability, but other research topics and categories are available at the [Ethereum research Discourse forum](https://ethresear.ch/), and there are others that improve scalability but also improve other properties, e.g. security, decentralization, and transparency.
