The roadmap is an active area of research. The outline below is only intended to provide flavour, with more details in specifications (which have been released for phases 0 and 1 as of 14 Dec 2018, as linked to below). It is intended for this document to be maintained with ongoing R&D.

## Ethereum 2.0
### <strong>Phase 0</strong>: PoS beacon chain without shards
   * PoS beacon chain using Casper FFG for finality
   * Validators create an RNG via RANDAO in block proposals
   * Validators organize into proposers and attestation committees from the output of the RNG
   * Validators create crosslinks for stubbed shards
   * See the [phase 0 spec][(https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/master/specs/core/0_beacon-chain.md) FMI.

### <strong>Phase 1</strong>: Basic sharding without EVM
   * Blobs (Binary Large Objects) are collated in shards without transactions (which require execution)
   * Proposers submit blobs
   * Notaries
   * For more details, see the [phase 1 spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/master/specs/core/1_shard-data-chains.md) and [implementations](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-introduction-R&D-compendium#implementations).

### <strong>Phase 2</strong>: EVM state transition function
   * Full nodes only
   * Asynchronous cross-contract calls only
   * [Account abstraction](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-101.md)
   * [eWASM](https://github.com/ewasm/design); the eWASM team is working on Ethereum 2.0 integration after being developed (although not integrated in production yet?) with 1.0 clients.
   * TBC: archive accumulators: [History, state, and asynchronous accumulators in the stateless model](https://ethresear.ch/t/history-state-and-asynchronous-accumulators-in-the-stateless-model/287) and [Batching and cyclic partitioning of logs](https://ethresear.ch/t/batching-and-cyclic-partitioning-of-logs/536) and [Double-batched Merkle log accumulator](https://ethresear.ch/t/double-batched-merkle-log-accumulator/571)
   * Storage rent: [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-simple-and-principled-way-to-compute-rent-fees/1455) and [here](https://ethresear.ch/search?q=storage%20rent); [bandwidth fees](https://ethresear.ch/t/incentivizing-a-robust-p2p-network-relay-layer/1438); and other mechanism design to internalize costs while improving UI.

### <strong>Phase 3</strong>: Light client state protocol

   * Executors
   * [State-minimized clients](https://ethresear.ch/t/state-minimised-executions/748). [Stateless clients](https://ethresear.ch/t/the-stateless-client-concept/172) are not ideal as we don't want to offload all storage into secondary markets, rather we can give people a choice to pay storage rent on the blockchain or pay for it in secondary markets.

### <strong>Phase 4</strong>: Cross-shard transactions: see [here](http://notes.ethereum.org/s/BJc_eGVFM#cross-shard-communication) and [more](https://ethresear.ch/search?q=cross-shard).

   * Internally-synchronous zones: [mind map including architectures](https://www.mindomo.com/zh/mindmap/sharding-d7cf8b6dee714d01a77388cb5d9d2a01)
   * See also [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/synchronous-cross-shard-transactions-with-consolidated-concurrency-control-and-consensus-or-how-i-rediscovered-chain-fibers/2318/5)

### <strong>Phase 5</strong>: Tight coupling with main chain security: [here](https://hackmd.io/s/HJ_BbgCFz#%E2%9F%A0-1600---1645--Ethereum-20-End-game) and [more](https://ethresear.ch/search?q=tight%20coupling).

   * Data availability proofs: [A note on data availability and erasure coding](https://github.com/ethereum/research/wiki/A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding), [Sharding and data forgetfulness](https://ethresear.ch/t/sharding-and-data-forgetfulness/61)
   * [Internally fork-free sharding](https://ethresear.ch/search?q=internally%20fork-free)
   * Manager shard: may be difficult with the latest spec as it uses a beacon chain rather than a contract.

### <strong>Phase 6</strong>: Super-quadratic or exponential sharding

   * Recursively, shards within shards within shards... Again, this may be difficult with the latest spec as it uses a beacon chain rather than a contract.
   * Load balancing: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)), [search results](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=load+balancing&t=canonical&ia=web). Related: [History, state, and asynchronous accumulators in the stateless model](https://ethresear.ch/t/history-state-and-asynchronous-accumulators-in-the-stateless-model/287), [State minimized implementation on current evm](https://ethresear.ch/t/state-minimized-implementation-on-current-evm/1255)
