# Welcome to the Ethereum Wiki

This is the community maintained wiki covering all sorts of information on the next-generation peer-to-peer technology platform built by the Ethereum Foundation, including **Ethereum**, _the generalized blockchain for smart contract development_, as well as sister protocols like **Whisper**, _the private low-level datagram communication platform_, and **Swarm**.

## Contribution guidelines

Users signed in with GitHub can edit and add pages using the [browser](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-wiki-pages-via-the-online-interface) or [locally](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-and-editing-wiki-pages-locally). Do not change the title of a page, as the link for it will change. In particular, if you change the title for this page, the link https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/, as well as the Wiki tab in the header of this repo, will just direct to a list of pages, rather than this page, so don't change the title of this page! If you want to translate a page, create a new page and translate the original there. Consider previewing your changes before saving them, and if you detect any errors, fix them.

## Getting started
To get the basic concepts of Ethereum visit [http://ethereum.org](http://ethereum.org/). For another introduction targeted for end users but also for developers and others, see [here](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-introduction).

If you want to get a deeper understanding, start by reading the [whitepaper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper) and the [design rationale](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Design-Rationale). For a more formal review, read the [yellow paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf). If you are interested in being a core developer, find a project that interests you, and start contributing to that (probably pro-bono initially, until maintainers like you and decide to hire you). For Ethereum research and protocol architecture, see https://ethresear.ch. If you are interested in developing smart contracts you can see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#Programming_languages), as well as under dapp development in the sidebar.

## Status / Releases / development timeline/roadmap
See [here](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Releases).

## Don't get lost
Check the [Glossary](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Glossary) and our [FAQS](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/FAQS). There are separate wikis for information relevant to the [C++](https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/wiki), [Go](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki) and [Rust](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki) implementations ([Python](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/wiki) and [Javascript](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-lib/wiki/Architecture) have basic wikis).

## Downloads/projects
Bleeding edge code can be cloned from the develop branch of GitHub repositories such as those [here](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Clients).
