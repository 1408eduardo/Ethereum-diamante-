[(Verbatim from the home page.)](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki#license-and-contributor-license-agreement)

All new contributions are under the CC0 license, so in other words by contributing to this wiki you are agreeing to publish your contributions in the public domain, with no rights reserved. To state that you accept this fact before contributing, please add yourself to the list of external contributors [here]( https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/CC0-license#list-of-contributors). Otherwise, without adding yourself to the list, your contributions will be all rights reserved. You may also wish to add a HTML comment to the pages that you contribute to, like so: `<!--*Name Surname*, Github username, **email@domain** and/or other contact methods-->`. Some previous contributions may have all rights reserved (by contributors that have not agreed to a CC0 license [at pull request 528](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/pull/528)), since no copyright permission was stated explicitly.

***
#### External Contributor example
- *Name Surname*, Github username, **email@domain** and/or other contact methods. 

(An email or other contact methods are optional, but preferred in case you have set a no-reply public Github email address, or if your Github account is deleted. However, to prevent spam and too many emails, you may prefer to list public contact methods such as your Twitter username and your website.)
