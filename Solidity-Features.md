This is a list to explain and demonstrate new Solidity features as soon as they are completed.
It is used as a kind of changelog and items introduced at some point might be changed at a later point. The official reference is the [Documentation](http://solidity.readthedocs.org/) which should always reflect the current state of the language.

This page is **not** the official documentation for Solidity. It contains outdated information.

## Events in Exported Interfaces

**This point needs to be added to the Solidity documentation.**

[PT](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/87036508) Events are exported to the JSON and Solidity interfaces generated by the compiler. The contract
```js
contract c {
    event ev(uint indexed a);
}
```
generates the JSON interface
```js
[
   {
      "inputs" : [
         {
            "indexed" : true,
            "name" : "a",
            "type" : "uint256"
         },
         {
            "indexed" : false,
            "name" : "b",
            "type" : "uint256"
         }
      ],
      "name" : "ev",
      "type" : "event"
   }
]
```
and the Solidity interface
`contract c{event ev(uint256 indexed a,uint256 b);}`.
