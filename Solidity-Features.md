This is a list to explain and demonstrate new Solidity features as soon as they are completed.
It is used as a kind of changelog and items introduced at some point might be changed at a later point. The official reference is the [Documentation](http://solidity.readthedocs.org/) which should always reflect the current state of the language.

This page is **not** the official documentation for Solidity. It contains outdated information.

## Events in Exported Interfaces

**This point needs to be added to the Solidity documentation.**

[PT](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/87036508) Events are exported to the JSON and Solidity interfaces generated by the compiler. The contract
```js
contract c {
    event ev(uint indexed a);
}
```
generates the JSON interface
```js
[
   {
      "inputs" : [
         {
            "indexed" : true,
            "name" : "a",
            "type" : "uint256"
         },
         {
            "indexed" : false,
            "name" : "b",
            "type" : "uint256"
         }
      ],
      "name" : "ev",
      "type" : "event"
   }
]
```
and the Solidity interface
`contract c{event ev(uint256 indexed a,uint256 b);}`.

## SHA3 with arbitrary arguments

**If this is still true (for `keccak256`), we need to add this to the official documentation.**

[PT](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/86896766). `sha3()` can now take an arbitrary number and type of arguments.
```js
contract c {
  function c()
  {
      val2 = 123;
      val1 = sha3("foo"); // sha3(0x666f6f)
      val3 = sha3(val2, "bar", 1031); //sha3(0x7b6261720407)
  }
  uint256 val1;
  uint16 val2;
  uint256 val3;
}
```

## Inline members initialization

**This point seems to be missing from the official documentation.**

[PT](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/84982976) Inline members can be initialized at declaration time.
```js
contract test {
  function test(){
    m_b = 6;
  }
  uint m_a = 5;
  uint m_b;
}
```
