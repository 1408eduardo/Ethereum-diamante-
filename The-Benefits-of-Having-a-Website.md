Tworld has changed, how people do work has changed, marketing principles have changed, how business is conducted has changed – Welcome to the digital world or IoT (Internet of Things). 

Ask any person to find a product or service for you on a street and the probability of this person using Google or leading you to a website is more than 99 %. Of course, there is a 0.1% chance of the person giving you an address of a brick & mortar location, but, seriously? It is because of this very reason that it has become practical for businesses to own a website. 

Apart from it being a platform through which you are able to reach your intended clientele and inform them of what you have to offer, a good website is capable of doing much more than that among which include creating databases, executing automated transactions, gaining feedback from clients about products and services, linking it to social media, sending automated responses via email and much-much more without additional costs. 

The only cost your business will incur is the cost of developing the website using a professional [web developer](https://www.onlineinvent.com.au/website-design-web-development-melbourne)and if it is done right the maintenance costs of a website is quite negligible for most small and medium enterprises. The complexity for the ‘web elements’ mentioned above are manageable even by a 15-year-old regular internet user. 

As a marketing platform websites allow you to advertise much farther and wider than any traditional marketing processes at a much lesser cost. 

For example if you intended to send 1000 printed flyers, how much would it cost? In the same instance sending a promotional email with a link to your site or posting it on a social media platform could reach millions of people in less than a minute if you conduct proper due diligence prior to sending your email out. 

The number of people your email gets through to is cost insensitive, 1, a million or a billion, the cost is the same. 

The primary reason to use a [web developer](https://www.onlineinvent.com.au/) is to provide an entirely professional website. A website provides legitimacy to a business similar to what business cards, letterheads and official stamps did for businesses only two decades ago.

Nowadays, even with a business card, letterheads and official stamps, without a website, the chances of a business making it or reaching its objectives is closer to ‘zero’ than anything else. This ‘closer to zero’ scenario is an evident fact because all your competitors own a website!  

In essence, a website should not be considered a value point, or an added service provision, but instead a website should be seen as a primary feature of a business similar to that of a shop front or the reception area of a hotel and its frontal façade that greets customers. The website will act as the platform for ‘first engagements’ to take place between your business and its clients. 

Whatever the business has to offer and the quality and value of the offers are perceived through the quality of the website. Therefore a website nowadays is an essential business tool or platform without which chances of a business failing increases 10 fold. 

Websites, social media platforms are not just the ‘Internet of things’ but the way business actually work and there are no two ways about it.
