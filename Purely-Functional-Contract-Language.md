Hearing that the dao hacking,
I think that some purely functional language is a must for contract code safety.
I am now reading ocaml code which is simple functional language. 
Since I am not an expert, I do not know how the ocaml assembly is made .
Ocaml is , like Lisp, now written by itself. 
I do not know even the fact the borrow checker in Rust Language is really safe.
So, I am now starting with the ABC of Functional Programming Language.
