3. CLIENTS:  Kle Tech

4. USERS: Common people

|Questions such as|	This question helps the designer to|
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
|How will the machine be used in the drawing?|	
|How much it can cost?|	
|What other features is expected?|	Identify client’s objective| 
|What does plane drawing mean?|	                                     
|What’s the maximum weight that machine can be?|	
|What materials can the machine be made of?|	Identify constraints|
|How does input should be provided to machine?|	
|How should machine interact with the user?|	Identify constraints|
|What kind of drawing is expected?|	










## Following was the information obtained through basic research 

|Observe from lit. Survey|	Requirements|
|------------------------|------------------|
|Based on the weight of other machine| 	Machine should be light weight|
|A machine start to draw figures according to the input|	Input should be  given by the user accordingly| 
|Based on the competing products in the market|	Cost of the machine should be at the range of  3000 to 4000|
|Based on the drawing tool|	Drawing tool should be added and removed manually|

	

## 1.1	Prepare a list of design objectives

1] It should draw the structure based on the input  

2] It should be user friendly

3 ] It should be light weight.

##  Revised problem definition:
 Design a plane drawing machine, which draw the structures based on the input provided, which should be user friendly and should be light weight.

## 1.2 prioritize the identified design objectives 
Priority among various objectives is set through a technique called pair wise comparison chart (pcc)

|Goals||||Score|
|-----|-|-|-|----|
||****||||			
|||****|||		
||||****||	

Based on the information gathered through interaction with client, initial survey and completing phase 1.1 the problem statement is formulated as follows 

## 1.3 identify constraints 
1. It must contain a drawing tool.
2. It must be non conducting material.
3. cost must be less than 4000. 
Revised problem definition: Design a plane drawing machine, which draw the structures based on the input provided, which should be user friendly and should be light weight.

## 1.4 Identify functions: 
1. It should possess sensors. 
2. It should be controlled by both manual RC and AI

## Revised problem definition:
 “Design and build an plane drawing machine, which could draw the structures based on the input Provided, and as light as possible and can contain drawing tool of any light weight and non conducting material. It should be user friendly, which must be able to possess sensors and controlled by both manual RC and AI. And the machine should not cost more than Rs.4000 “
