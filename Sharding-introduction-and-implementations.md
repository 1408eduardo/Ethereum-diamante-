Implementations under development include:
- py-evm/Trinity: [Gitter](https://gitter.im/ethereum/py-evm), [Github: sharding](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/tree/sharding), [Github: Trinity](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/tree/trinity). Trinity is the planned/under development EVM that will run a node and network.
- Geth-sharding: [Github](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/geth-sharding), [Gitter](https://gitter.im/prysmaticlabs/geth-sharding), [website](https://prysmaticlabs.com/).
- [Drops of Diamond](https://github.com/Drops-of-Diamond/Diamond-drops): in Rust.
- Nimbus ([doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14u65XVNLOd83cq3t7wNC9UPweZ6kPWvmXwRTWWn0diQ/edit#)): an implementation in Nim which compiles to C, and would be good for integrating with [Hera](https://github.com/ewasm/hera), an eWASM implementation in C++.
