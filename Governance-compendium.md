### Against on chain governance:
* https://medium.com/@Vlad_Zamfir/against-on-chain-governance-a4ceacd040ca. Snippets: "On-chain governance makes node operator participation in governance completely unnecessary." However, node operator participation is necessary for the current protocol. Thus, changing to on-chain governance is very risky. "Unless there are governance processes that get Sybil-resistant input from node operators, on-chain governance therefore always has the potential to disenfranchise node operators (and users) of the blockchain." [Vlad's reply to a comment to this post](https://medium.com/@Vlad_Zamfir/its-only-just-a-design-problem-da3806ff5114).
